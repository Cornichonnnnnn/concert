- Basic hygiene in package and module structure and naming consensus.
- Soft and hard limits, distinguish?
- Make hard limits determination by SocketAxis a string pattern or abstract function? Do all devices support queries about hard limits?
- ContinuouslyMovable is position really not settable on any device which actually exists? Sounds ridiculous. Reconsider how to model it.
- Calibration - are there any axes on which one must apply calibration manually? Does one really need to calculate it programatically?
- Agree on how much the control package should be distributed.
- Quantities package is not recommended to use for production purposes, does it suggest it is unstable? Do we have any experience with it?
- How to deal with states? Explicitly? Leave the state handling to events?
- Should units be part of Axis or Controller?
- Make attributes like position and velocity classes? (limits, set values, current values, ...)
- What about soft position limit checking when moving continuously?
- Add precision to Axis attributes?

- Is coupling senders and messages tightly a good idea? (e.g. a  listener which wants a particular message from all senders)
- Axis wait_for method: what if the desired state change happens between state check and dispatcher wait method?
- Why has wait_for in Axis a callback? User waits and then does whatever they want.
- Change set position to non-blocking by default? (more device operate in that mode?)
- Event id generation
- wait and subscribe nomenclature
